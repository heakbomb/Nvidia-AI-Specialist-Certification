## Title

Real-time road traffic sign detection and analysis system using cameras and artificial intelligence

## Opening background information

</aside>

---

Recently, the importance of driver assistance systems has been increasing as much as the advancement of autonomous driving technology. The traffic sign detection and analysis system helps to operate safely and effectively while driving by recognizing and analyzing the surrounding environment in real-time.

## General description of the current project

---

This project uses cameras to detect and analyze each traffic sign in real-time through AI, and then relays this information to the driver while they are driving.

## **Proposed idea for enhancements to the project**

---

It helps to automatically recognize traffic signs that could be missed in complex road situations, alerting the driver and thus reducing accidents or cases of deviating onto incorrect routes.

## **Current limitations**

---

There are issues with the system not accurately detecting signs when they are obscured by other objects or environmental factors, and there is a need for improvements in real-time processing requirements and performance.

## Video Acquisition Method

---

I recorded the video from inside a moving car.

## - DarkLabel

**The video is cropped to fit 640x640.**
